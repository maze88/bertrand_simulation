# bertrand_simulation
Short script by Michael Zeevi to simulate the result of the Bertrand's box paradox:

There are three boxes:

1. a box containing two gold coins,
2. a box containing two silver coins,
3. a box containing one gold coin and a silver coin.

The 'paradox' is in the probability, after choosing a box at random and withdrawing
one coin at random, if that happens to be a gold coin, of the next coin also being
a gold coin.
